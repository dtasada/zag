# Overview

## Introduction
This page is an overview/introduction to the Zag programming language. It's not a programming tutorial though and I assume you know the basics of programming like variables, functions, statements, etc.

If you haven't yet installed Zag, you can read how to in the [Getting Started](../getting-started/README.md) guide.
